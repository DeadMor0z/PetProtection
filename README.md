# Pet Protection
Don't want to go to the effort of taming some two-star boars, only for a stray greyling to get in and kill them all?
Don't want to bring your trusty wolf into battle, because of the probability of its untimely demise?

Then this mod is for you.  Rather than outright death, mortally wounded tame creatures will instead be knocked unconscious for 15 minutes.  Unless killed by you, with a butcher's knife.

Thanks to the V+ team for putting it AGPL so that I could tear the relevant code from it into this stand-alone mod. Equivalent to running V+ with the Tamed animals settings set to "Essential".
